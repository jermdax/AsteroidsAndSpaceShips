## Compiling
If you are compiling from the command line, make sure you are located in the topmost directory of this repo
(you should be able to see a src directory if you list the files)
then compile by issuing the command `javac -cp src src/game/Game.java`.
It can then be run from the same directory by running `java -cp bin/ game.Game`
